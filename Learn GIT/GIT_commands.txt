1. To check if git is installed correctly, use -->
    git --version

2. When we install git first time, we have to set the config, so others can know who has changed which line of code
    git config --global user.name "Rahul Raj"
    git config --global user.email "rahulraj94391@gmail.com"

    and if you want to change the username or the email ID -->    
    git config --global --edit
    "vim editor" will get open and then you can make changes, and then to exit press "ESC" and write ":wq" to come out of vim editor.

3. make a git repository (To track a folder changes)
    we use "git init" command to initialize that folder which we want to track.

4. git status
    this cmd is used to know what changes(add, delete, edit) are done to this repo

5. git add "filename.extension" (use this if u want to add a single file in that folder)
    git add . (use this if you want to add every file and folder at once)
    use this to start tracking a file.
    this command pushes the files from "working dir" to "staging area".
    Staging area is the section where git holds the changes before "commiting" to the repo.

6. git commit -m "initial commit"
    use this cmd to commit the changes to the repo.
